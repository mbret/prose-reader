# Performances

This library needs to be very careful with everything that impact performances (eg: reflow, heavy dom computation). Whenever possible we should use
asynchronous lookup and mechanisms that defer, batch or are fast enough to not impact user experience while reading books.

An example of common issue is `getBoundingClientRect`. Getting elements position is a common use case across prose-reader. Ideally it should always
be in a very controlled way and with better performance alternative when possible (eg: `IntersectionObserver`)
