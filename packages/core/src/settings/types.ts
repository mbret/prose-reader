   * content using a service worker or a backend service and the item uri will hit theses endpoints.
   *
   * @example
   * - Web app with back end to serve content
   * - Web app with service worker to serve content via http interceptor
   *
   * If for whatever reason you need a specific behavior for your items you can specify a function.
   * @example
   * - Web app without backend and no service worker
   * - Providing custom font, img, etc with direct import
   *
   * @important
   * Due to a bug in chrome/firefox https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=880768 you should avoid
   * having a custom fetch method if you serve your content from service worker. This is because when you set fetchResource
   * the iframe will use `srcdoc` rather than `src`. Due to the bug the http hit for the resources inside the iframe will
   * not pass through the service worker.
